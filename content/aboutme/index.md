## What I do
I have been programming code for more than a decade, and I am still learning and dedicating myself to it, mainly in the field of geoinformatics. I am a geographer by profession, but I have a master's degree in computer science, as well as a background in different fields of engineering. 

My skills are focused on GIS development, spatial data analysis and research, which is my passion. Specifically, I am interested in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and artificial intelligence (AI). I master analysis in different languages such as Python or R, and specifically Earth Observation (EO) and deep learning technologies (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Wandb, Github, etc.). 

My experience has led me to participate in local and international projects, allowing me to work in interdisciplinary, multicultural and multilingual groups. In recent years, my taste for academia led me to teach courses and/or workshops at the university and to participate in research projects. From here I highlight RGEE, Cloudsen12 and others on the application of different methods of analysis for spatial analysis.

Finally, the years have helped me to master project management methodologies (traditional and agile) and to manage the software lifecycle properly, establishing workflows to achieve the objectives of the commissioned projects.


## How I got here

My journey began with my undergraduate studies in Peru, where I spent several years working across various sectors, tackling challenges related to spatial data management. This experience sparked my interest in programming languages, starting with R, progressing through Python and JavaScript, to C++. Before I knew it, this path led me to pursue a master's degree in computer science. The wealth of experience I gained not only boosted my confidence but also equipped me to independently manage comprehensive projects and contribute to research initiatives. Following two years of pandemic-induced isolation and in pursuit of international opportunities, the University of Salamanca came into the picture, offering me a sponsorship that enabled me to venture overseas. This academic transition was significant, marking one of the most profound and growth-filled phases of my life. Despite missing my family and friends back home, the joy of engaging in work I'm passionate about is immensely fulfilling.

## Where I am

Currently, I reside in √Åvila, Spain, balancing my time between work and my PhD studies at the University of Salamanca. During holidays, I seize the opportunity to return to Peru, where my parents and siblings live, providing a perfect escape from the (for me) extreme weather conditions here in Spain.

## My free time

In my leisure moments, I enjoy diving into different programming languages and exploring various frameworks. Cycling and wandering through the fields offer me a refreshing break from my routine. In the urban landscape, I take pleasure in meandering from one corner of the city to another, strolling alongside the river, and exploring quaint towns. Another passion of mine is designing and creating 3D models with my Prusa MK4. These hobbies provide a creative outlet and a chance to unwind from my academic and professional pursuits.
